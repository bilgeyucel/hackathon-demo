cycles can’t possibly be captured by a single program. In an ideal world, says Tremback-Ball, everyone who wanted to learn about cycle syncing for their own body would have an informed coach to help them develop an individualized program. Eisenlohr-Moul recommends trying a program for a month or two if you’re interested, and to pay close attention to whether or not it actually makes you feel any better, or if it’s taking more effort than it’s worth. “If your workout is not making you happy because it's being dictated by something,” says Tremback-Ball, throw it out and “do what makes you happy.” Your hormones will be just fine.
