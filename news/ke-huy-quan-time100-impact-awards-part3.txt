yet he's so humble. He's so kind. And that is something that I aspire to every day. With Michelle, I've been a fan of hers for many, many years. What I talked about earlier about bringing positive energy to the set—that's her every time she comes to set. She's really happy and wants to make the best movie we can. What would you like to see change in the future of the industry? I’d like to see more diversity, more inclusion, equal pay, and equal opportunities for all groups of people. I want to see the people who have the power to make decisions to be bold and brave and to tell stories that we don’t normally tell. There are a lot of great actors who are just waiting for the spotlight and I hope one day that those actors will get the chance to shine. What do you think needs to happen for us to get there? I think it needs to come from every department of this business. You know, writers can only write what they can sell, so producers and studios need to buy scripts that are new and challenging. We need more AAPI talent to be working not only in front of the camera, but behind the camera as well, too.. I just think there needs to be more AAPI writers, directors, producers, and people behind the camera. The studios need to do more to tell those stories. What do you hope your legacy is? I don't know if I have an answer to that yet. Because I still have so much stuff I want to do. I don't know what's going to define me 10 years from now, but so far what has happened to me has been incredible. WRITE TO CADY LANG AT CADY.LANG@TIMEMAGAZINE.COM. SHARE THIS STORY
