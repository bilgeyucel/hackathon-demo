stress is related to communicating with a partner. Perhaps you don’t talk about major purchases, or you haven’t aligned on your money goals. Not talking about money can add to existing financial stress, even if it’s not the direct cause of the concern. Learn healthy communication styles and try to set aside time to sit down with your partner to discuss finances. Plan ahead so that you’re both as rested as possible, and in a good space to discuss financial issues. Sometimes money provokes strong emotions during discussions, so being as comfortable as possible is a big part of keeping things as amicable as possible. 7. Get outside advice and help Don’t assume you have to do this on your own. Sometimes getting an outside view can help you better identify areas where you can improve. A financial professional is trained to provide planning services and advice. With help from someone else, you can create an effective plan to save for your most important goals and pay down debt. A service like SmartAsset can match you with a professional that matches your needs. If you have someone in your corner and know you’re making good decisions, you might see a reduction in the amount of financial stress you feel. *Interest Rates Current as of April 4, 2023. **Limit of 6 withdrawals per statement cycle.
