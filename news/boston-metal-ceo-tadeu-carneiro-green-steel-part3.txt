pledges to be carbon neutral by 2050. They all understand that you can't solve the problem overnight, there will be a transition. And in this transition, you will try several different things to see what is going to be the most efficient. You’ve gotten a lot of funding recently. What are you planning to do with it? The use of these funds is mainly broken into two main fronts. One is funding and scaling up what is already a commercial application of the technology in Brazil to get value from mineral wastes, and that should consume around $100 million from the funding. The reason why that is very important is because we will start generating revenues to help fund the balance of the program, which is scaling up the technology for green steel. Do you have any plans for a larger green steel plant? The next milestone is a semi-industrial cell. It's not called “industrial” just because it doesn't produce enough to make sense for what the steel industry uses. It will run here in Woburn, Mass., from the second part of next year onward. We will have our first industrial demonstration unit sometime in 2025. And we want to become commercial with the technology in 2026. I would say the first million-ton or 2 million tons-size plants would be running in something like 2028. But now the most important thing is getting this semi-industrial cell running in Woburn, Mass., next year. Once we do that, you are in business, because the pressure to solve [this] is so big that it's only a question of the time to build a big plant. Correction, Sept. 15 The original version of this story misstated Boston Metal's near term goal. The company will be licensing the technology for mass production of steel, not mass producing steel itself. WRITE TO ALEJANDRO DE LA GARZA AT ALEJANDRO.DELAGARZA@TIME.COM. SHARE THIS STORY
