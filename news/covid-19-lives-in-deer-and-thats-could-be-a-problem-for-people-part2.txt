mutations. For now, it appears the deer-harbored virus hasn’t evolved to become more dangerous to people. Bowman and his colleagues infected hamsters who had been vaccinated with the latest COVID-19 shots with the deer virus and the hamsters continued to produce antibodies that neutralized the virus. But resolving some of the mysteries about how deer are getting infected, and what the virus is doing in that animal population, will be important for protecting human health longer term. “The question is, is the virus changing in the deer population away from what we had in the human population?” says Bowman. “I’m not as concerned if we have a deer- to- human transmission event occurring today. It’s more concerning if the virus is continuing to evolve away from what is circulating in humans now, and five, 10, or 20 years down the line there is a virus circulating in the deer population to which humans are immunologically naïve, so it can come back in and cause disease. Are we setting up a new reservoir species so that eventually human immunity will not be protective against whatever is circulating in deer?” MORE MUST-READS FROM TIME The Case for Mediocrity How Russia Is Recruiting Cubans to Fight in Ukraine Paul Hollywood Answers All of Your Questions About The Great British Baking Show Meet the 2023 TIME100 Next: the Emerging Leaders Shaping the World Oprah and Arthur C.
